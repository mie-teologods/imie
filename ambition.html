<p>I want to be a professional programmer in the future. 
 I am interested in becoming a computer programmer because I love using computers and can already design simple programs.
 I have been interested in computers since I was in high school. I am currently taking an advanced programming class in Data science. I think I can design useful or entertaining programs that people will like.
 <br>
 So that I can also fulfill the dream of my brother and our parents. I also want to go to another country with my family.
