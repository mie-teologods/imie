<p>From every grade level I had a happy experience. I met a lot of people. 
 There are many worries that will not be forgotten this year because this is where I started how to sew and attach wires. 
 I also remembered that time when our whole section made us go around outside the room. 
 Even though I didn't get an award, I'm still happy that I finished my grade level in life. 
 I remembered when we graduated, I took a picture of my crush, I will never forget that, it's still my gallery.
