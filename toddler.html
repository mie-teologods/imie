<p>Story about me when I was a child I always cried and I was a shy child. 
 It's also a story that my uncle took care of me while my parents were at work. 
 There is a story my mother told me when I was a child, That while mother was cooking a dry dish and put it on the table. 
 And they say I secretly take a dry dish and hide it under the table to eat.
