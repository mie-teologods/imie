<p>In high school, you will meet people who can change the stupidity and nonsense you keep from your friends. This is also one of the many assignments that you just want to explode and disappear, but even so, it will help us a lot because of the increase in our knowledge, this is also where I learned to do calligraphy. My high school life is the happiest event that we will never forget.
