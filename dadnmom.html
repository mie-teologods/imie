<p>My parents met at the bakery. My mother is a seller at the bakery and my father is a buyer there. So dad always buys there just to see mom. 
 And that's when they met mom and dad and they became friends. As time went on, dad lost his way with mom.
 It all started when my father met my mother and they fell in love and they had two children and that's us.
